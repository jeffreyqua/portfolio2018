      <h1 class="section__title">About</h1>
      <p>I build and design experiences.</p>

      <p>Iâ€™m a designer, developer, videographer. My passion is to create immersive experiences using digital mediums. My background in computer science and interaction design gives me a flexibility in being able to fill in any skill gaps in any type of creative team.</p>

      <h2 class="section__subtitle">Development</h2>
      <p>I have worked in a variety of different development environments from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Angular, React, Rails, and also to more traditional objective-oriented languages such as C++ and Java.</p>

      <h2 class="section__subtitle">Design</h2>
      <p>My design experience has made me proficient with the Adobe Suite such as photo editing with Photoshop and Lightroom and vector-based tools like Illustrator. Most of my interface work nowadays is using Sketch. I am also proficient in small scale video production and edit using Premiere and audio editing such as Audacity. I have previous experience in a variety of 3D modelling programs as well such as Cinema4d, 3DS Max, and SolidWorks.</p>

      <h2 class="section__subtitle">More</h2>
