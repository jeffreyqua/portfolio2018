        <h3 class="project__block-title">Objective</h3>
        <p>Live In Levis was an experimental site that blended digital storytelling and e-commerce through use of video and an interactive interface. This website won the <a href="https://thefwa.com/cases/the-live-in-levi-s-project">FWA of the day</a> award on Sep 28, 2014.</p>

        <p>The site used videos as the central point of the experience and through user interactions, dynamically updated the content based off both the user actions and the videoâ€™s current state.</p>

      <section class="project__block">
        <h3 class="project__block-title">Approach</h3>
        <p>Using the user's current video state, the interface displayed contextually relevant artist/story details, branded product information, and also user-generated social media content.</p>

        <p>The site had some organizational challenges with video and multi-locale support. We had a CMS integration in order to support 10 different  regions with support for multiple languages.</p>

      <section class="project__block">
        <h3 class="project__block-title">Process</h3>
        <p> The site content was implemented through a third-party CMS to support multi-region/language content moderation. Stories were managed through Prismic, while user-generated content was managed through ThisMoment.</p>

        <p>In order to determine effectiveness of the experimental interactivity, click analytics tracking was implemented for the data science team to review.</p>
